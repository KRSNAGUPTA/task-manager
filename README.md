# Task Management Application

## About the Application
The Task Management Application is a simple, responsive web app that allows users to manage tasks effectively. With features like task creation, priority setting, and filtering, users can keep track of completed and active tasks and search for specific tasks easily.

### Key Features:
- **Task Creation**: Add tasks with titles, descriptions, and priorities (low, medium, high).
- **Filter & Search**: Filter tasks by status (all, active, completed) and search for specific tasks.
